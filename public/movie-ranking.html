<h1>The Best Movies According to Sam</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring</h3>
<p>This is my favorite Lord of the Rings movie. 
    It has so many cool scenes and is the start to a legendary trilogy and book. </p>
<h3>John Wick</h3>
<p>I love this movie, I think it's very fun and action packed, 
    and I love the choreography.</p>
<h3>Jujutsu Kaisen 0</h3>
<p>One of my favorite new anime movies. It's a great prequel to the anime and has a ton of cool fighting sequences, and introduces everyone to one of my favorite characters in Jujutsu Kaisen: Yuta Okkotsu.</p>
